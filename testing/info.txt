Info about general Linux commands:

cd | cd {dir_name} | changes directory, you can also put a chain of directories (e.g. cd Documents/English/Essays/)

ls | ls (-a , -las) (dir, current if blank) | lists items of directory, common flags are -a which lists all files even hidden ones, and
	-l which lists permisson, file size, and access information besides filenames.

pwd | pwd | prints current directory and tree of directories leading to current directory (e.g. pwd -> /home/alex/Documents/)

cat | cat {filename} | prints out the content of a file, can be garbled if the file doesn't directly tranlate to text, like a photo or
	mp3 file. 

echo | echo {some text} | prints given text to output, unless used in conjunction wit > or >> operators (which will be discussed later).

man | man {command} | you can use the man command to pull up a man page for a certain command, a man page is a help page that explains
	how to use the command. Most commands also have to option to do: {command} --help, which will display a shortened version of a
	man page.

grep | grep {some text} | searches for given text, useful in conjunction with piping (| symbol) to search through output of a command
	like cat or ls.

tr | tr (flags) {item} {replaced item} | tr is the translate, or replace tool. together with grep they create the normal
	ctl+f find and replace tool you see in something like a word doc. tr takes the first input and replaces all occurrances of it
	with the second input. there are some flags but refernce the man 
	or help page for them 

redirect, > and >> | {command} > {file} or {command} >> {file} | the redirect command takes the output from a command and redirects it into a file
	instead of printing it to the terminal. the > option writes, but overrites any content already in the file, and >> appends the 
	data to the file.
